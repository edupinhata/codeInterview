# Code Interview

Welcome to Thales code interview. The following problems were designed so we can understand a little bit more about your coding skills.

For this challenge, you'll share your screen with us while you go through the problems. 
It's really important to get the Problems right, but more than the following skills will be evaluated:

- Problem solving skill
- Thinking process to get to the solution
- Strategy to get solution when you don't have the tools memorized.

**OBS:** Feel free to search syntax in the internet. You can also search for solutions, but since the process to solve the problem is evaluated, the less the better.

### **<u>Requirements:</u>**

For this test, you'll need:

- Connection to the internet
- Access to a brownser

### Implementation environment

- All problems will be implemented in the [Codeanywhere]([https://repl.it](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) site.

### **<u>Time limit</u>**

- You'll have 15 minutes only to read this document. You can't solve anything within this time. You can read code as well.
- The problems should be solved in a time limit of 1 hour.


### **<u>Languages</u>**

You can choose one of the following languages to solve the problems:

- Java
- Python
- C++
- Javascript (Node) 

There is no extra points for an specific language, so use the one you feel more
