# Code Interview

Welcome to Thales code interview. The following problems were designed so we can 
understand a little bit more about your coding skills.

For this challenge, you'll share your screen with us while you go through the problems. 
It's really important to get the Problems right, but more than this we'll check other 
skills like:
- Problem solving skill
- Thinking process to get to the solution
- Strategy to get solution when you don't have the tools memorized.

**OBS:** You can search syntax and solutions in the internet.
