# Intern Technical Test

Welcome to Intern level technical interview. The following problems were designed so we can understand a little bit more about your code skills.

For this challenge, you'll share your screen with us while you go through the problems. 
It's important to get the Problems right, but more than this we'll check other skills like:

- Problem solving skill
- Logical skills
- Thinking process to get to the solution

**OBS:** You CAN NOT search solutions in the internet.

You'll have 4 sections with different types of questions:
1. Logic and Problem Solving
2. Programming Theory
3. Implementation
4. System Design

You have 1 hour to go as far as possible in the test providing good quality solutions.

## 1. Logic and Problem Solving

### 1.1 Buckets measure
You have two buckets: one 5-liter bucket and one 3-liter bucket. Using these two buckets, how do you measure exact 4 liters? 

### 1.2. The Bridge and Torch Problem
Four people must cross a bridge at night. They have one torch, and the bridge can hold at most two people at a time. Each person walks at a different speed (1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes). When two cross together, they move at the slower person’s pace.
What is the fastest time all four can cross?

### 1.3. The Two Egg Problem
You are in a 100-story building. You have two identical eggs. The eggs may or may not break if dropped from a given floor. Once an egg breaks, it can’t be reused.
What is the minimum number of drops required to find the highest floor from which you can drop an egg without breaking it?

## 2. Programming Theory

- 2.1. What is the difference between compilation and interpretation?
- 2.2. Explain the difference between a local variable and a global variable.
- 2.3. What is an algorithm? Can you give a simple everyday example?

## 3. Implementation

- [Problem 3.1: Calculate Factorial](../../Problems/Implementation/I_5_calculateFactorial/README.md)
- [Problem 3.2: findThe3BiggestNumbers](../../Problems/Implementation/I_6_findThe3BiggestNumbers/README.md)

## 4. System Design

- 4.1. If you had to design an application to manage tasks in a to-do list, what basic features would you implement?
