# Thales DevOps Technical Interview

Welcome to Thales DevOps Technical Interview. 

The following problems were designed so we can understand a little bit more about your direct and indirect DevOps skills, and how is your though process while solving some problems.

For this challenge, you'll share your screen with us while you go through the problems.

### Time limit

The test should be discussed in 1 hour.

### Search

You can use internet to search about things you don't know, is not sure about or want to exemplify something.
