# Logical Reasoning / Problem-Solving questions

### 1. Mark time with rope
You have two ropes that each burn for exactly 1 hour, but they don’t burn at a uniform rate (sometimes faster, sometimes slower). How can you measure 45 minutes using only these ropes?

### 2. Light bulb and switches
 You are standing in a room with three light switches. Each switch controls exactly one incandescent light bulb in the next room. The door to the next room is closed, and you cannot see inside.
You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but you are only allowed to enter the next room once.
How can you determine which switch controls which bulb?

### 3. Buckets measure
You have two buckets: one 5-liter bucket and one 3-liter bucket. Using these two buckets, how do you measure exact 4 liters? 

### 4. The Wolf, the Goat, and the Cabbage
A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. His boat can only carry him plus one item at a time.

If left alone, the wolf will eat the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbage.
How can the farmer get all three across safely?

### 5. The Bridge and Torch Problem
Four people must cross a bridge at night. They have one torch, and the bridge can hold at most two people at a time. Each person walks at a different speed (1, 2, 7, and 10 minutes). When two cross together, they move at the slower person’s pace.
What is the fastest time all four can cross?

### 6. The Poisoned Wine Puzzle
You have 1000 wine bottles, and one is poisoned. The poison is so strong that even a sip is deadly, but it takes 24 hours to show effect. You have 10 prisoners to test on.
How can you determine which bottle is poisoned within 24 hours?

### 7. The juice problem
You have 1000 bottles of juice, and exactly one of them is spoiled. The spoiled juice has a special property: if someone drinks it, they won’t feel sick right away, but after exactly 24 hours, they will show clear signs of illness.

You have 10 lab rats (or testers) to help you, and you want to figure out which single bottle is spoiled in only one round of testing. You may give each tester sips from any combination of bottles.

How can you determine which bottle is spoiled within 24 hours?

### 8. Monty Hall Problem
A game show host shows you three doors. Behind one is a car, behind the others are goats. You choose one door. The host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens another door revealing a goat. You are then asked:
Do you want to stay with your choice or switch? What strategy gives you the best odds?

### 9. The Two Egg Problem
You are in a 100-story building. You have two identical eggs. The eggs may or may not break if dropped from a given floor. Once an egg breaks, it can’t be reused.
What is the minimum number of drops required to find the highest floor from which you can drop an egg without breaking it?

### 10. The Truth-Tellers and Liars
You are on an island where inhabitants are either always truthful or always liars. You meet two people, and one says: “We are both liars.”
What are they?

### 11. The Weighing Coins Puzzle
You have 12 coins, identical in appearance, but one is counterfeit (either heavier or lighter). You have a balance scale and can use it only three times.
How do you find the counterfeit coin?
