## Fix The Code: Sorting algorithms

### <u>Context</u>

The source folder contains a code with some [sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) for integer arrays, which are algorithms that organize elements by how each element is compared to other. For example, we can sort an integer array from the smaller to the greater number. Or we can sort strings alphabetically.

Among the sorting algorithms, there are the Bubble Sorter and the Insertion Sorter. The following gif example shows visualy how these algorithms works and how they're implemented in the code of this problem

#### <u>Examples</u>

### <u>The Problem</u>

In this problem:
- There are syntax error that will raise some errors
- There are some runtime errors that will make the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
- There are some semantic errors that will make the program to run, but will return the wrong result.

a. Fix all syntax errors, so the program runs without errors.

b. Fix all runtime errors so the program run without crash.

c. Fix all semantic errors so the array is sorted from the **smaller number to the greater number**.

d. At the end you must run the Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
e. (Optional) After fix the errors, you can improve the code quality to make it easier to read, more organized, or even more optimized.

### <u>Setup instructions For browser development</u>

1. Download the Source folder [clicking here](https://github.com/edupinhata/codeInterview/raw/main/Problems/FixTheCode/FTC_1_sorting-algorithms/python/source.zip).
2. Create a **Pyhton templeate** in  of **Codeanywhere** with any name you want.

3. Delete the current files and add the files of the source folder in the project created on step 2. Either drag and drop, or use the upload function in the three dots menu of repl.it. 
  
`Don't upload the folder, but only the files !!!`

4. Press the **Run** button in the top right corner to execute the code.
