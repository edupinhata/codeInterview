## Fix The Code: Sorting algorithms

### <u>Problem</u>

The source folder contains a code with some [sorting algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm) for integer arrays.

In this problem:
- There are syntax error that will raise some errors
- There are some runtime errors that will make the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
- There are some semantic errors that will make the program to run, but will return the wrong result.

a. Fix all syntax errors, so the program runs without errors.

b. Fix all runtime errors so the program run without crash.

c. Fix all semantic errors so the array is sorted from the **smaller number to the greater number**.

d. At the end you must run the Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.

e. (Optional) After fix the errors, you can improve the code quality to make it easier to read, more organized, or even more optimized.


### <u>Setup Instructions</u>

1. Download the Source folder [clicking here](https://github.com/edupinhata/codeInterview/raw/main/Problems/FixTheCode/FTC_1_sorting-algorithms/python/source.zip).
2. Create a **Pyhton templeate** in  of **Codeanywhere** with any name you want.

![Create_codeanywhere](https://github.com/edupinhata/codeInterview/blob/main/Problems/FixTheCode/FTC_1_sorting-algorithms/images/codeanywhere_create.png)

3. Add the files of the source folder in the project created on step 2. Either drag and drop, or use the upload function in the three dots menu of repl.it. 
  
`Don't upload the folder, but only the files !!!`

4. Press the **Run** button to execute the code.
