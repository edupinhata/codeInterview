# Calculate Factorial

Factorial of a natural number **n**, represented by **n!**, is the product of all positive integer numbers from 1 to **n**. 

For example, if n = 5, n! = 5.4.3.2.1 = 120.

1. Make a program that calculates the factorial of **n**.
2. What is the biggest **n** that can be calculated?
