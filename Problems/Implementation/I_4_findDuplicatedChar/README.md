# Find Duplicated Char

Consider a String as input. The program should find characters that are duplicated and print them.

Example:

**Input:** 
```
this is a string.
```

**Output:**
```
t  is 2 times.
i  is 3 times.
s  is 3 times.
   is 3 times.
```

The order of duplicated letters should be according to how they are found in the string.
