Problems that need to be solved using implementation.

## Difficulty Levels:

- **Intern:** Problems that a person that already done the first classes of a programming graduation (E.g.: Computer Science, Systems Analysis and Development, Computer Engineering) should already knows. It includes basic concepts of programming in at least one programming language: conditions, loops, functions, input and output.
- **Junior**: Problems that a preson that just conclued a programming graduation should be able to solve. It includes basic concepts of programming, object orientation, database, cloud application notion, problem solving skills. 
- **Medium**: Problems that a person that has some experience working with programming: Junior's knowledge + experience solving problems, deploying products, reviewing code, find and propose better soltion that are simple and efficient.
